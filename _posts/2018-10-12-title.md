This week we did pair programming and I learned the difference between navigator and driver. We also learned more about the put image function and defining shapes. We solved complex problems by working together. We also kept working on our flags, but on the computers by using shapes. For example, if you want to create the Japanese flag, you could use a white rectangle and and place a red circle in the middle with put-image. Good week, productive.
