This is a flag that I created using the x and y coordinates of two blue rectangles and a white rectangle in the background. It is the flag of Finland. This was a challenge because we had to use the place-image functions in more creative ways. It was more complex due to the fact that the function only worked with two images. We used place image function in the definition side of pyret so that we could combine two images and then use it to combine it with another image. If your flag was more complex, it would use more definitions. I did Ukraine and Finland, and Ukraine took two shapes while Finland took three shapes. If you did a flag like Bahamas, you would do 4 or 5 shapes. I mostly did flags that have rectangles because personally I think it's easier.
